# Request: Enable “Time Tracking” Field for Sub-Tasks in Jira Project

Hi [Admin Name],

Could you please enable the “Time Tracking” field (Original Estimate) for Sub-task issue types in our Jira project? This will allow us to update Original Estimate via the API for Sub-tasks.

---

## Step-by-step Instructions

### 1. Go to Project Settings
- Open the Jira project.
- Click on **Project settings** (bottom left).

### 2. Open Screens or Issue Layout
- In the sidebar, select **Screens** (Classic projects) or **Issue Layout** (Jira Cloud/Next-gen).

### 3. Find Sub-task Issue Type
- Locate the screen scheme or layout for **Sub-task** issue types.

### 4. Edit the Screen
- Click **Edit** next to the relevant screen (usually “Edit Issue” and “View Issue”).
- If using Issue Layout, click **Configure** for Sub-task.

### 5. Add “Time Tracking” Field
- In the list of available fields, find **Time Tracking**.
- Drag it into the screen layout (or click “Add”).
- Make sure it appears in both **Edit** and **View** screens for Sub-tasks.

### 6. Save and Publish
- Click **Save** or **Publish** to apply changes.

## Screenshot Guidance

- **Project Settings navigation:** Show sidebar with Project Settings highlighted
- **Screens/Issue Layout section:** Show the section where screens/layouts are managed
- **Sub-task screen configuration:** Show the Sub-task issue type screen
- **“Time Tracking” field added:** Show the field in the screen layout
- **Save/Publish confirmation:** Show the save/publish button

---

## Why?
- The API can only update fields present on the screen for the issue type.
- This will allow us to keep Original Estimate functionality for Sub-tasks via automation.

Thanks so much,
