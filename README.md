# JiraCSVviaAPI-1 ‚Äî Stable Release v1.32

**Bulk import Outlook calendar events into Jira Cloud with unified menu interface, robust field mapping, idempotent import, bulk transition capabilities, and full logging.**

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the unified toolkit:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Access all functionality through an organized menu system
   - Use numbered options (1-9) or keyboard shortcuts (I, P, U, C, E, T, W, F, R, Q)
   - Automatically returns to menu after each operation for continuous workflow

3. **Alternative: Run individual scripts:**

   ```bash
   python jiraapi.py
   ```
   - Follow the interactive prompts for credentials, CSV path, and field choices.
   - Review `output.csv` when prompted, then confirm to proceed with import.

3. **CSV Format:**

   Your Outlook CSV export should have these columns:

   ```csv
   Subject,Start Date,Start Time,End Time
   ```
   - The script will automatically rename `Subject` to `Summary` and add all required Jira columns during processing.
   - The script will prompt for missing/required fields during prep.
   - For sub-tasks, set `Parent` to the Jira key (e.g., `PROJ-123`) or summary of the parent story.
   - Only rows without a `Created Issue ID` will be imported.

## Automated Bulk Transition Workflow

**Quick Start (Recommended):**
```bash
python main.py
# Select option 7 (or press 'W') for automated workflow
```

**Manual Step-by-Step:**

For efficiently completing large numbers of Jira issues:

1. **Export your issues:**
   ```bash
   python jira_export_my_issues.py bulk_transition_issues.csv
   # OR use main.py ‚Üí option 5 (E) ‚Üí option 1
   ```

2. **Review the exported issues** (optional - check issue types and current statuses)

3. **Run bulk transition with automatic detection:**
   ```bash
   python jira_bulk_transition.py bulk_transition_issues.csv
   # OR use main.py ‚Üí option 6 (T)
   ```

4. **Review the results:**
   - Check console output for summary
   - Review `transition_report.csv` for detailed results
   - Handle any failed transitions manually if needed

**Smart Status Detection:**
- **Epics & Stories** ‚Üí automatically transitioned to "Closed"
- **Tasks & Sub-tasks** ‚Üí automatically transitioned to "Done"
- **Manual Override** available if you need all issues to go to the same status

   - Robust normalization, header mapping, and exclusion logic for Outlook exports.
   - Interactive prompts for required fields and CSV path.
   - Automatic renaming of `Subject` to `Summary` and addition of required Jira columns.

   - Fetches Jira field metadata (`jira_fields.json`) before import for field mapping and debugging.

**3. .env Variable Management**
   - Interactive prompts for Jira fields and .env variables, with persistent saving.
   - Project ID is a persistent .env variable and never double-prompts.

**4. Field Mapping Review**
   - Interactive utility to review and update Jira custom field mappings before import.

   - Only new rows (without Created Issue ID) are processed, ensuring safe re-runs.

**6. Resolution Status Management & Autoclose**
   - At the start of import, choose how to set the Resolution/Status for all created issues and sub-tasks:
     - **Prompt for each issue:** Closed (default), In Progress, Backlog, or custom transition per issue.
     - **All issues auto-transitioned:** Closed All, In Progress All, or Backlog All (no further prompts).
   - The "All" options apply the selected status to all issues and sub-tasks without further prompts.

**7. Jira API Integration**
   - Imports Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Sub-tasks from CSV.
   - Handles parent/epic linkage for stories and sub-tasks.
   - Updates Story Points, assignee, Start Date, Time Spent, and Parent after creation for all issue types (including sub-tasks).
   - Sub-task logic robustly supports Story Points and time tracking (with clear toggles).

**8. Logging & Tracking**
   - Persistent logging to `tracker.csv` and `error.log`.
   - All API interactions, payloads, and errors are logged for full traceability and troubleshooting.
   - All outgoing payloads and responses are logged for debugging.

**9. Workflow Flexibility**
   - Supports advanced and basic workflows.
   - .gitignore rules to exclude generated/log files.

## Story Points on Sub-tasks

By default, Story Points are updated for ALL issue types, including sub-tasks. To turn OFF Story Points for sub-tasks:

1. Open `jiraapi.py` and find:

   ```python
   allow_sp_on_subtasks = True  # <--- DEFAULT: Story Points are updated for sub-tasks
   # To turn OFF Story Points for sub-tasks, change the above line to:
   # allow_sp_on_subtasks = False
   ```
2. Change `allow_sp_on_subtasks = True` to `allow_sp_on_subtasks = False` and save the file.

You can also control this via the field mapping review utility by setting the `Allow Story Points on Sub-tasks` option when prompted.
