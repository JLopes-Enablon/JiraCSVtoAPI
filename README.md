# JiraCSVtoAPI Automation Toolkit

## Getting Required Jira Variables

Before using this toolkit, you will need the following Jira variables:

- **JIRA_URL**: Your Jira Cloud or Server URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`)
  - **How to get it:** Log in to your Jira account in your browser. Copy the base URL from your browser's address bar (it will look like `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`).

- **JIRA_EMAIL**: The email address associated with your Jira account
  - **How to get it:** Click your profile icon in the top right corner of Jira, then select "Profile". Your email address will be shown on your profile page.

- **JIRA_TOKEN**: A Jira API token
  - **How to get it:**
    1. Go to [Jira API tokens page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
    2. Click "Create API token".
    3. Enter a label (e.g., "JiraCSVtoAPI") and click "Create".
    4. Copy the generated token and save it securely (you will need to paste it into the script prompt).

- **JIRA_PROJECT_ID**: The key of your Jira project (e.g., `PROJKEY`)
  - **How to get it:**
    1. In Jira, open your project.
    2. The project key is shown in the project sidebar and in the URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PROJKEY/boards/1` â€” here, `PROJKEY` is the project key).

- **JIRA_ASSIGNEE** (optional): Username or account ID to assign issues
  - **How to get it:**
    1. In Jira, click on your profile icon and select "Profile" to see your username/account ID.
    2. For other users, go to "People" in the top menu, search for the user, and click their name to view their details.

You will be prompted for these when running the scripts for the first time. They are stored in a `.env` file for future runs.

## Required CSV Format for Input

Your input CSV must have the following columns (header row required):

```
Project,Summary,IssueType,Parent,Start Date,Story Points,Original Estimate,Time spent,Priority
```

**Notes:**
- `IssueType` can be `Epic`, `Story`, `Task`, or `Sub-task` (case-insensitive)
- `Parent` is the parent issue key (for sub-tasks or linked stories)
- `Start Date` should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `Story Points` and `Original Estimate` are optional but recommended (Pending change from Jira admins to be enabled for API)
- `Created Issue ID` will be filled in by the script after import

## Overview
This toolkit automates the process of importing issues and work items into Jira from CSV files. It supports both pre-formatted work item CSVs and calendar exports (Outlook/Teams), providing scripts for cleaning, mapping, and bulk importing data.

## Features
- Import pre-formatted Jira work item CSVs
- Prepare Outlook/Teams calendar exports for Jira import
- Bulk create issues and sub-tasks in Jira via REST API
- Update Story Points and Original Estimate fields for Stories
- Map CSV columns to Jira fields, including custom fields
- Check and map Jira field metadata
- Menu-driven workflow for easy selection and execution

## Scripts
- `main.py`: Main menu and workflow selection
- `jiraapi.py`: Bulk import and field update logic
- `Outlook prep.py`: Calendar CSV cleaning and formatting
- `field_check.py`: Field mapping and metadata check

## Usage
1. Run `main.py` to start the toolkit and select your workflow:
   - Option 1: Import pre-formatted Jira work item CSVs
   - Option 2: Prepare Outlook/Teams calendar exports for Jira import
2. Follow prompts to clean, map, and import your data.
3. Use `field_check.py` to verify field mapping if needed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Example CSVs
- `output.csv`, `June.CSV`, `Outlook.csv`, `mystuff.csv`: Example files for different import workflows

## Notes
- Ensure correct field mapping for custom fields (e.g., Story Points)
- For calendar exports, run `Outlook prep.py` before importing to Jira

## Detailed Functions and Features

Below is a detailed overview of the main functions and features provided by this toolkit:

### Main Scripts

- **main.py**
  - Provides a menu-driven interface for users to select workflows.
  - Handles user input and launches the appropriate scripts for importing work items or preparing calendar exports.
  - Ensures a guided, user-friendly experience for bulk operations.

- **jiraapi.py**
  - Core logic for importing issues and sub-tasks into Jira from CSV files.
  - Handles authentication, environment variable management, and API communication.
  - Supports bulk creation of issues, sub-tasks, and updates to fields like Story Points and Original Estimate.
  - Includes error handling, logging, and field mapping logic.
  - Prompts for required variables and stores them securely in a `.env` file.

- **Outlook prep.py**
  - Cleans and formats Outlook/Teams calendar CSV exports for Jira import.
  - Normalizes event data, removes unnecessary columns, and outputs a compatible CSV for further processing.
  - Ensures calendar data is ready for bulk import as work items.

- **field_check.py**
  - Checks and maps CSV columns to Jira fields, including custom fields.
  - Helps users verify that their CSV headers match the expected Jira field names and IDs.
  - Can be used independently to troubleshoot field mapping issues.

- **jira_field_names_export.py**
  - Exports all available Jira field metadata to a CSV file.
  - Useful for advanced users who need to map or reference custom fields in their imports.

- **jira_bulk_transition.py**
  - Allows bulk transitioning of issues (e.g., moving multiple issues to a new status) via the Jira API.
  - Can be used after import to update workflow states in bulk.

- **jira_check_transitions.py**
  - Checks available transitions for a given Jira issue key.
  - Helps users understand which workflow states are available for a specific issue.

- **jira_export_my_issues.py**
  - Exports all issues assigned to or reported by the current user to a local CSV file.
  - Useful for backup, reporting, or further processing.

### Key Features

- **Bulk Import**: Import multiple issues and sub-tasks from a single CSV file, reducing manual entry and errors.
- **Calendar Integration**: Prepare and import Outlook/Teams calendar events as Jira work items, streamlining time tracking and reporting.
- **Field Mapping**: Map CSV columns to Jira fields, including support for custom fields and field validation.
- **Menu-Driven Workflow**: User-friendly menu system for selecting and executing workflows without needing to remember script names or arguments.
- **Environment Management**: Securely prompts for and stores Jira credentials and configuration in a `.env` file, keeping sensitive data out of source code.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Comprehensive error messages and logging to help diagnose issues during import or API operations.
- **Transition Management**: Bulk transition issues to new workflow states, and check available transitions for any issue.
- **Export Capabilities**: Export your own issues from Jira for backup, migration, or analysis.

### Helper and Test Scripts

- **test_fixes.py**: Contains tests for field update logic, ensuring Story Points and Original Estimate updates work as expected.
- **fix_field_updates.py**: Utility for testing and fixing field update behaviors in Jira.

### File Structure Notes

- **output.csv, Outlook.csv, June.CSV, mystuff.csv**: Example and output files for different workflows.
- **.env**: Stores Jira credentials and configuration (excluded from version control).
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all required Python packages for the toolkit.
- **.gitignore**: Ensures sensitive and output files are not committed to version control.
